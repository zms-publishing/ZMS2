Installing the ZMS Product


    This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
    and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
    something like:

        $ cp LDAPUserFolder-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ tar zxvf zms-xyz.tgz
        <watch files being decompressed>

    Windows users can use WinZip or similar, it can handle tarred 
    gzip files. Make sure to move the extracted zms 
    folder to your Zope installation's lib/python/Products-folder.

    That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.
